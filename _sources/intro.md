# Welcome to *PoreNum*!
[*Poromechanics with Numerical implementations*]

## What is it ?

***PoreNum*** is built as a collection of small lectures and implementation examples on the subject of poromechanics,
from the theoretical basis of poromechanics and necessary mathematical tools for model implementations to various concrete examples.
It can be followed from beginning to end as a comprehensive lecture on numerical poromechanics, or specific parts of interest only can be selected.

## For whom ?

I designed this series of lectures with the ambition that anyone with some rudiments of mathematics and mechanics could follow it,
making them as pedagogical and progressive as possible.
Whether you are a skilled experimenter who wants to value their experimental results by complimenting them with numerical simulations,
a young student willing to delve for the first time into poromechanics and numerical modelling, or simply curious,
I hope you can learn something out of ***PoreNum***.


## Contents

This website is constituted of 3 main parts.
A first section is dedicated to the theory of poromechanics, where we will explain the basis of thermodynamics for porous media and how to derive constitutive models.
A second section tackles some prerequisites on numerical methods for solving equation systems, which we will rely on in the numerical implementations.
Finally, the third section shows a number of implementation examples that will hopefully inspire you and allow you to write your own code for your application.
Feel free to follow everything in order or directly jump into the part you are the most interested in !

## About the author

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Laboratoire Navier](https://www.navier-lab.fr), École nationale des ponts et chaussées.
My research focuses on multi-physics couplings in porous media, with a strong emphasis on numerical methods.
