# Welcome to PoreNum: Poromechanics with Numerical implementations

This collection of small lessons and numerical example are aimed at anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with the theories of mechanics and physics of porous continua,
and/or willing to delve into numerical implementations of poromechanical models.
It is also suitable for whom wants to learn or review some basics of solving equation systems as well as python coding,
which will be subsequently used in numerical examples.
